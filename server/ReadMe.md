# MemoBac API

## Requirements

Make sure to have the following tools installed on your machine.
- Docker
- Postman (to test the server without the front-end)

---
## Step 1: Clone the repository
```shell  
git clone https://github.com/clemzouuu/MemoBac.git
```  

## Step 2: Run the Server

1. **Create and start a MySQL Database** (it will work with the server)
```shell  
docker-compose up --build  
```  
2. **Install the dependencies** (in a new terminal)
```shell  
npm install  
```
3. **Start the development server**
```shell  
npm run dev  
```
4. **Done!** The API is now running on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)  
   For now, the database is empty. You can start by registering and creating a card.

    "password": "123"
}
```

```

- Body
```json

- Token: none

IMPORTANT! Make sure to note down the token returned by the API, you will need it for all your requests.

```

    "question": "What is the meaning of life ?",

}
```
